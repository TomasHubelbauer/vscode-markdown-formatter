# VS Code MarkDown Line Rule Auto-Breaker

What will this extension do? It will allow you to write your MarkDown prose as usual, without worrying about the line
rule (80 / 120 characters etc., taken from the VS Code settings to respect your choice) and it will break the lines
into the correct length automatically. It will do a word-break and it will not break links.
